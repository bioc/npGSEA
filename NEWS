CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4 (November 9 2014)
------------------------

   o Added some checks to the values of XG and Y 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3 (November 8 2014)
------------------------

   o Made the epsilonBetaAdj=FALSE as the default option.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2 (November 2 2014)
------------------------

   o Set a minimum p-value for the Beta approximation as the default, but allowed it be changed with the 'epsilonBetaAdj' parameter in the main function.  

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1 (October 19 2014)
------------------------

    o Added a requirement that each treatment group have at least two observations.
    o Set a minimum p-value for the Beta approximation so that it never returns a value of zero

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2 (May 22 2014)
------------------------

    o Added x-axis labels to plots
    o Changed 'z' to 'covars' in the npGSEA function
    o Added a new function 'pValues' which returns all appropriate p-values for a given npGSEAResult object
    o Added a new function slot to the npGSEAResult objects, betaHats.  This vector contains the betaHats for each gene in the gene set.  Users can thus now see each gene's individual contribution to the test statistics.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1 (April 22 2014)
------------------------

    o Fixed a typo in stat accessor for Beta approximation 

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0 (March 31 2014)
------------------------

    o Package submitted to Bioconductor
